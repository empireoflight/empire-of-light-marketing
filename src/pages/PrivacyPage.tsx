            This policy covers empireoflightcollective.com and app.empireoflightcollective.com — the marketing site and the Empire of Light app.
            It explains what we collect, how it’s used, and — in more detail than a typical privacy policy — exactly how our privacy-tier
            system controls who can see what inside the app.

            The short version: what you write is yours. We built the app so that most of what you share is either never stored, locked to you
            specifically, or only ever surfaced to your team in anonymized or explicitly-shared form. The section below on privacy tiers is the
            most important part of this page — read that first if you only read one thing.

            <Eyebrow color="#FEE16A">How your data maps to our privacy tiers</Eyebrow>
            <p className="m-0 text-[16px] leading-[1.7] md:text-[17px]" style={{ color: 'rgba(251,247,242,.75)' }}>
              Every piece of content in the app is assigned one of five privacy tiers, and that tier is visible to you right where you enter the
              data — so you always know who can see what before you write it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-px overflow-hidden rounded-xl border" style={{ background: 'rgba(251,247,242,.14)', borderColor: 'rgba(251,247,242,.14)' }}>
            {TIERS.map((tier) => (
              <div key={tier.n} className="p-8" style={{ background: '#0C0A0D' }}>
                <div className="mb-3 text-[13px] font-semibold tracking-[0.16em]" style={{ ...DISPLAY, color: '#FEE16A' }}>
                  TIER {tier.n} &middot; {tier.label.toUpperCase()}

            These boundaries are enforced at the database level, not just in the app’s interface — so a bug in a screen somewhere can’t
            accidentally expose Tier 0/1 content to people who shouldn’t see it. Only automated, server-side processes can turn Tier 1/2 content
            into a Tier 3 aggregate; no person — including Empire of Light staff — can browse Tier 0/1/2 content directly.

              Empire of Light is designed to build trust between a team and the leadership who sponsor it — not to give leadership a window

              from the same kind of anonymized, aggregated signals described in the privacy tiers above — enough to show the program is
              working, without exposing what any one person wrote.

              conversation with your leadership, that’s entirely your call to make. We just won’t do it for you, and we won’t share it on your
